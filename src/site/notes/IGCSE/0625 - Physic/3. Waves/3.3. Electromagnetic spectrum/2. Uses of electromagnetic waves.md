- Electromagnetic waves have a variety of uses and applications
- The main one are summarised in the table below:

- A summary of the uses and dangers of different EM waves are summarised in the diagram below:

#### Radio waves and microwaves uses
- These 2 parts of the spectrum share a lot of similarities and applications:
	- They're mainly used in wireless communication - in fact, many things that people assume use radio wave actually use microwaves (e.g. WiFi, radar, mobile phones, satellite communications).
- At a very high **intensities (amplitudes)**, microwaves can also be used to **heat** things.
	- This's what happens in a microwave oven.

#### Infrared uses
- Infrared is emitted by **warm objects** and can be detected using **special cameras** ([thermal imaging cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_imaging_camera)). These can be used in industry, in research and also in medicine.
- Many security cameras are capable of seeing slightly into the **infrared** part of the spectrum and this can be used to allow them to **see in the dark**.
    - Infrared lights are used to illuminate an area **without being seen**, which is then detected using the camera.
- Remote controls also have small **infrared LEDs** that can send **invisible signals** to an **infrared receiver** on a device such as a TV.
- Infrared travels down **fibre optic cables** more **efficiently** than visible light, and so most fibre optic communication systems use infrared.

#### Visible uses
- **Visible light** is the **only** part of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eye **can detect**.
- The human eye can detect wavelengths from **750 nanometres** (red light) up to **380 nanometres** (violet light).

#### Ultraviolet uses
- **Ultraviolet** is responsible for giving you a **sun tan**, which is your body’s way of protecting itself against the ultraviolet
- When certain substances are exposed to ultraviolet, they absorb it and **re-emit** it as **visible light** (making them glow).
    - This process is known as **fluorescence**.
    - **Fluorescence** can be used to secretly mark things using special ink – in fact, most **bank notes** have **invisible fluorescent** markings on them.
- Fluorescent light bulbs also use this principle to emit visible light.

#### X-ray uses
- The most obvious use of **x-rays** is in **medicine**.
- X-rays are able to pass through most body tissues but are absorbed by the denser parts of the body, such as bones.
- When exposed to x-rays, the bones absorb the x-rays, leaving a shadow which can be seen using a special x-ray detector or photographic film.

#### Gamma rays uses
- **Gamma rays** are very **dangerous** and can be used to **kill** cells and living tissue.
- This property can be utilised in both **cancer detection** and **treatment**
    - If these gamma rays are carefully aimed at **cancerous tissue**, they can be very effective at **destroying** the **cancerous cells**.
- Gamma rays can also be used to **sterilise food** and **medical equipment** by killing off the bacteria.
