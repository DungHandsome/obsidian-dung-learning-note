## A. Digital & Analogue signals
- There're 2 types of signals:
	- **Analogue**
	- **Digital**

- Analogue signals **vary continuously** - they can take any value.

- A digital signal can **only take one of two** (discrete) states.
- There're usually referred to as:
	- **1**s and **0**s
	- **High**s and **Low**s
	- **On**s and **Off**s

## B. Transmission of Sound
- Sound waves that can be transmitted as a **digital** or **analogue** signal
- Signals for speech or music are made up of **varying frequencies**
    - In order to make out the information clearly, the signal needs to be transmitted with as **little interference** as possible

- The signal goes is converted **both before transmission** and **after being received**
    - Before transmission: the signal is converted from **analogue** to **digital**
    - After being received: the signal is converted from **digital** to **analogue**

## C. Benefits of digital signalling
- An analogue signal consists of **varying frequency** or **amplitude**
    - Examples of analogue technology include telephone transmission and some broadcasting

- A digital signal is generated and processed in two states:
    - 1 or 0 (high or low states respectively)

- The key **advantages** of transmission of data in **digital** form compared to analogue are:
    - The signal can be regenerated so there is minimal noise
    - Due to accurate signal regeneration, the **range** of digital signals is **larger** than the range of analogue signals (they can **cover larger distances**)
    - Digital signals enable an **increased rate of transmission of data** compared to analogue
    - Extra data can be added so that the signal can be checked for errors
