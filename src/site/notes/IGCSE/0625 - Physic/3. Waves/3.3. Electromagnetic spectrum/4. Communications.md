## A. Communication with satellites
- Geostationary and polar orbiting (low orbit) satellites are both used for communicating information

### I. Geostationary satellites
- Geostationary satellites orbit **above the Earth’s equator**.
- The **orbit** of the satellite is **24 hours**.
	- At a **height** of **36000 km** above the Earth’s surface, much higher than **polar satellites**.
	- Used for **radio** and **telecommunication broadcasting** around the world due to its high orbit.

### II. Polar satellites
- Polar, or low orbit, satellites orbit around the **Earth’s north and south poles**
- These orbit much **lower** than **geostationary satellites**, at around **200 km** above sea level
	- Used for monitoring the **weather**, **military applications**, and **taking images** of the Earth’s surface
	- There is a much **shorter time delay** for **signals** compared to geostationary orbit signals
	- The signals and images are much **clearer** due to the lower orbit
	- However, there is limited use in any one orbit because more than one satellite is required for continuous operation

## B. Systems of Communications
- Many important systems of communications rely on **long wave** electromagnetic radiation, including:
    - Mobile phones, wireless internet & satellite television (using **microwaves**)
    - Bluetooth, terrestrial television signals & local radio stations (using **radio** waves)
    - Optical fibres (using **visible** or **infrared** waves)

### I. Radio waves
- Radio waves can be used to transmit signals over **short** distances 
    - Terrestrial (local) television signals, radio station transmissions and Bluetooth all work using radio waves
- Radio station signals are transmitted at a **longer** wavelength than terrestrial television signals
- In hilly areas, it may be possible to receive radio signals but **not** receive terrestrial television signals
    - This is because radio signals are more prone to **diffraction** around the hills
