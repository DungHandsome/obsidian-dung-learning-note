## A. Communication with satellites
- Geostationary and polar orbiting (low orbit) satellites are both used for communicating information

### I. Geostationary satellites
- Geostationary satellites orbit **above the Earth’s equator**.
- The **orbit** of the satellite is **24 hours**.
	- At a **height** of **36000 km** above the Earth’s surface, much higher than **polar satellites**.
	- Used for **radio** and **telecommunication broadcasting** around the world due to its high orbit.

### II. Polar satellites
- Polar, or low orbit, satellites orbit around the **Earth’s north and south poles**
- These orbit much **lower** than **geostationary satellites**, at around **200 km** above sea level
	- Used for monitoring the **weather**, **military applications**, and **taking images** of the Earth’s surface
	- There is a much **shorter time delay** for **signals** compared to geostationary orbit signals
	- The signals and images are much **clearer** due to the lower orbit
	- However, there is limited use in any one orbit because more than one satellite is required for continuous operation

## B. Systems of Communications
- Many important systems of communications rely on **long wave** electromagnetic radiation, including:
    - Mobile phones, wireless internet & satellite television (using **microwaves**)
    - Bluetooth, terrestrial television signals & local radio stations (using **radio** waves)
    - Optical fibres (using **visible** or **infrared** waves)

### I. Radio waves
- Radio waves can be used to **transmit signals** over **short** distances 
    - Terrestrial (local) television signals, radio station transmissions and Bluetooth all work using radio waves
- Radio station signals are transmitted at a **longer** wavelength than terrestrial television signals
- In hilly areas, it may be possible to receive radio signals but **not** receive terrestrial television signals
    - This is because radio signals are more prone to **diffraction** around the hills
- Radio signals tend to have wavelengths of around **a kilometer**, so the radio signals are more likely to have wavelengths **similar** to the size of the hill
    - This leads to **diffraction**, so radio signals can reach locations not in the line of sight of the transmitter, whereas TV signals **are not** diffracted

- Bluetooth uses radio waves instead of wires or cables to transmit information between electronic devices, over short distances, such as phones and speakers
    - Bluetooth signals tend to have **shorter** wavelengths than radio or television signals
    - This enables **high rates** of data transmission, but can only be used over a **short distance** (for example, within a household)
    - This means they can pass through walls but the signal is significantly **weakened** on doing so

### II. Microwaves
- Microwaves can be used to transmit signals over **large** distances 
    - Microwaves are used to send signals to and from **satellites**
    - Mobile phones, wireless internet, satellite (global) television and monitoring Earth systems (for example, weather forecasting) all utilise microwave communication
- As with radio waves, microwave signals will be clearer if there are no obstacles in the way which may cause diffraction of the beam
- On the ground, mobile phone signals use a network of microwave transmitter masts to relay the signals from the nearest mast to the receiving phone 
    - They cannot be spaced so far apart that, for example, hills or the curvature of the Earth diffract the beam
- When microwaves are transmitted from a dish, the wavelength must be small compared to the dish diameter to reduce diffraction
    - Also, the dish must be made of metal because metal reflects microwaves well
- Mobile phones and wireless internet use microwaves because microwaves are not refracted, reflected or absorbed by the **atmosphere** or **ionosphere**
    - This means satellites can relay signals around the Earth enabling 24-hour-a-day communication all around the world
    - Also, they can penetrate most walls and only require a short aerial for transmission and reception
