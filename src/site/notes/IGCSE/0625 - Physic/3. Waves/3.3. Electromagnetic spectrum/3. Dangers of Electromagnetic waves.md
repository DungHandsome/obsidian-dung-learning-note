- As the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) waves increases, so does the energy
- Beyond the visible part of the spectrum, the energy becomes large enough to **ionise** atoms
- Because of ionisation, ultraviolet waves, X-rays and gamma rays can have **hazardous** effects on human body tissue
    - The effects depend on the type of radiation and the size of the dose
- They can damage cells and cause mutations, making them cancerous
- The main risks associated with electromagnetic waves are summarised in the table below:

#### Microwaves
- Certain frequencies of microwaves are absorbed by **water molecules**
- Since humans contain a lot of water, there is a risk of **internal heating** from microwaves
- This might worry some people, but microwaves used in everyday circumstances are proven to be safe
	- Microwaves used for **communications** (like mobile phones) emit **very small amounts** of energy which are not known to cause any harm.
	- Microwave ovens, on the other hand, emit very large amounts of energy, however, that energy is **prevented** from escaping the oven by the metal walls and metal grid in the glass door.

#### Ultraviolet
- Ultraviolet is similar to visible light, except it is invisible to the human eye and carries a much higher energy
- If eyes are exposed to high levels of UV it can cause **severe** eye damage
    - Good quality sunglasses will absorb ultraviolet, preventing it from entering the eyes

- Ultraviolet is **ionising** meaning it can kill cells or cause them to malfunction, resulting in **premature ageing**, and diseases such as **skin cancer**
    - Sunscreen absorbs ultraviolet light, preventing it from damaging the skin

#### X-rays and Gamma rays
- X-rays and gamma rays are the most ionising types of EM waves
	- They are able to penetrate the body and cause **internal** damage
	- They can cause the **mutation** of genes and cause **cancer**

- Fortunately, the **level** of X-rays used in medicine is kept to minimum levels at which the risk is very low
    - Doctors, however, will leave the room when taking X-rays in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to them

- People working with gamma rays have to take several **precaution**s to **minimise** their exposure and are routinely tested to check their **radiation dose levels**
- For example, **radiation badges** are worn by medical professionals such as **radiographers** to measure the amount of radiation exposure in their body
