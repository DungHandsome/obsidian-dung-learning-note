## Electromagnetic waves
- The electromagnetic spectrum is arranged in a specific order based on the **wavelengths** or **frequencies**.
- The main groupings of the **continuous electromagnetic** (EM) spectrum are:
    - **Radio waves**
    - **Microwaves**
    - **Infrared**
    - **Visible (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)**
    - **Ultraviolet**
    - **X-rays**
    - **Gamma rays**

- The **higher** the **frequency**, the higher the **energy** of the **radiation**.

- Radiation with **higher energy** is:
    - Highly ionising
    - Harmful to cells and tissues causing cancer (e.g. UV, X-rays, Gamma rays)
- Radiation with **lower energy** is:
    - Useful for communications
    - Less harmful to humans


> [!tip] Exam Tips
> You can make a mnemonic to help you remember the EM spectrum!
> 
> Example: **R**aging **M**artians **I**nvaded **V**enus **U**sing **X**-ray **G**uns
> 
> The electromagnetic spectrum is usually given in order of **decreasing wavelength** and **increasing frequency** i.e. from radio waves to gamma waves
> Remember:
> - Radios are **big** (*long wavelength*)
> - Gamma rays are **emitted** from **atoms** which are very **small** (*short wavelength*)

## Properties of Electromagnetic waves
- Electromagnetic waves are defined as:

<center style="color: #c00000">Transverse waves that transfer energy from the source of the wave to an absorber</center>

- All electromagnetic waves share the following properties:
	- **Transverse**
	- Can travel through a **vacuum**
	- Travel at the **same speed** in a vacuum

- The speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000}{{3.0\times10^8} \; \text{m/s}}
$$

- This is approximately the same speed as electromagnetic waves in air
