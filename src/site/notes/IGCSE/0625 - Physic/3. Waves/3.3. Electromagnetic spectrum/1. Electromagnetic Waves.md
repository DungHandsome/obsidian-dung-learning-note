## Electromagnetic waves
- The electromagnetic spectrum is arranged in a specific order based on the **wavelengths** or **frequencies**.
- The main groupings of the **continuous electromagnetic** (EM) spectrum are:
    - **Radio waves**
    - **Microwaves**
    - **Infrared**
    - **Visible (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)**
    - **Ultraviolet**
    - **X-rays**
    - **Gamma rays**

- The **higher** the **frequency**, the higher the **energy** of the **radiation**.

- Radiation with **higher energy** is:
    - Highly ionising
    - Harmful to cells and tissues causing cancer (e.g. UV, X-rays, Gamma rays)
- Radiation with **lower energy** is:
    - Useful for communications
    - Less harmful to humans
