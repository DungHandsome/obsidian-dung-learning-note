## Dispersion of light
- White light is a mixture of **all** the color of the spectrum.
- Each color has a different wavelength (and frequency), making up a very narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- White light may be separated into all its colors by passing it through a **prism**.
	- This is done by refraction
	- Violet light is refracted the most, whist red light is refracted the least.
	- This splits up the colors to form a **spectrum**.
- This process is similar to how **rainbow** is created.

## The visible spectrum of light
- Visible light is defined as *the range of wavelengths which are visible to human*.
- Visible light is the only part of the spectrum **detectable** by the human eye.
	- However, it only takes up *0.0035%* of the whole electromagnetic spectrum.

- **Red** has the **longest wavelength** (and the lowest frequency and energy)
- **Violet** has the **shortest wavelength** (and the highest frequency and energy)

## Monochromatic light
- Light is a transverse wave
- The different colors of light all have different wavelengths (and frequencies)
    - Red has the **longest** wavelength
    - Violet has the **shortest** wavelength
- Light of a single wavelength (a single color), or single frequency, is known as **monochromatic**
