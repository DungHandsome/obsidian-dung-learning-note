## A. Features of lens diagrams
- Lens diagrams can be described using the following terms:
	- Principal axis
	- Principal focus or Focal point (**f**)
	- Focal length

- The principal axis is:

<center style="color: #c00000">A line which passes through the centre of a lens</center>

- The principal focus, or focal point is:

<center style="color: #c00000">The point at which rays of light travelling parallel to the principal axis</center>

- Focal length is:

<center style="color: #c00000">The distance between the centre of the lens and the principal focus</center>

## B. Converging & Diverging lenses
- A lens is a piece of equipment that forms an image by **refracting** light.
- there're 2 types of lens:
	- Converging
	- Diverging

### I. Convergin lenses
- In a **converging lens**, parallel rays of light are brought to a **focus**.
- This point is called the **principal focus**.
	- This depends on how **curved** the lens is
	- The **more curved** the lens, the **shorter** the focal length.

### II. Diverging lenses
- In a diverging lens, parallel rays of light are made to diverge (spread out) from a point.
	- This lens is sometimes referred to as a concave lens
- The principal focus is now the point from which the rays appear to diverge from.

### III. Representing lenses
- In the diagram, the following symbols are often used to represent each type of lens:

> Make sure you remember the symbol for each type of lens, as you will be expected to draw these for ray diagrams in your exam!
