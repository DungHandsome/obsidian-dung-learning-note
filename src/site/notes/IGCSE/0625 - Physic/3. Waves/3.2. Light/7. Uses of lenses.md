## A. Magnifying glasses
- If the object is placed closer to the lens than the focal length, the emerging rays diverge and a real image is no longer formed
- When viewed from the right-hand side of the lens, the emerging rays appear to come from a point on the left
    - This point can be found by extending the rays backwards (creating virtual rays)
- A virtual image will be seen at the point where these virtual rays cross

- In this case the image is:
	- **Virtual**
	- **Enlarged**
	- **Upright**

- Using a lens in this way allows it to be used as a **magnifying glass**
- When using a magnifying glass, the lens should always be held close to the object

## B. Correcting sight
- Converging and Diverging lenses are used in glasses to correct defects of sight.
	- Diverging lenses are used to correct **short-sighted** vision.
	- Converging lenses are used to correct **long-sighted** vision.

### Correcting short-sightedness
- People who're **short-sighted** have eyes that are 'too large', meaning the **focal point** is **in front of** the *retina*.
- This means they **can't** see things that are **far away**, and only see things that are **close** to them.
- This can be corrected by **concave** or **diverging** lenses which **focus the light rays** to make them **focus** on the *retina*.

### Correcting long-sightedness
- People who're **long-sighted** have eyes that are 'too small', meaning the **focal point** is **behind** the *retina*.
- This means they **can't** see things that are **close** to them, and only see things that are **far away** from them.
- This can be corrected by **convex** or **converging** lenses which **refract the light rays** to make the focal point lie on the *retina*.
