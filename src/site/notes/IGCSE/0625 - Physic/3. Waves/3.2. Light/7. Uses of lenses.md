## A. Magnifying glasses
- If the object is placed closer to the lens than the focal length, the emerging rays diverge and a real image is no longer formed
- When viewed from the right-hand side of the lens, the emerging rays appear to come from a point on the left
    - This point can be found by extending the rays backwards (creating virtual rays)
- A virtual image will be seen at the point where these virtual rays cross
