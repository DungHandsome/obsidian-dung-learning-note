## A. Total internal reflection
- Sometimes, when light is moving from a **denser** medium towards a **less dense** one, instead of being refracted, all of the light is **reflected**.
- This phenomenon is called **total internal reflection**.
- Total internal reflection (TIR) occurs when:

<center style="color: #c00000">The angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle and the incidence material is dense than the second material</center>

- Therefore, 2 conditions for total internal reflection are:
	- The angle of incidence > The critical angle
	- The incidence material is denser than the second material

- Total internal reflection is utilised in:
    - **Optical fibres** e.g. endoscopes
    - **Prisms** e.g. periscopes

### Prisms
- **Prisms** are used in a variety of optical instruments, including:
	- Periscopes
	- Binoculars
	- Telescopes
	- Cameras
	- Safety reflectors (for bikes and cars)

- A periscope is used to over tall objects
	- It consists of 2 right-angle triangles

- The light **totally internally reflects** in both prisms below:

## B. Critical angle
- As the angle of incidence is increased, the angle of refraction is also increased until it gets closer to 90°.
- When the angle of refraction is exactly 90°, the light is refracted along the boundary.
- At this point, the angle of incidence is called the **critical angle**, *c*.

![4. Total internal reflection-20240725071052295.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/3.%20Waves/3.2.%20Light/Resources/4.%20Total%20internal%20reflection-20240725071052295.webp)

- When the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle, the refracted ray is now **reflected**.
	- This is **total internal reflection**.

## C. Refractive index and Critical angle equation
- The **critical angle**, *c*, of material is related to its **refractive index**, *n* by the equation:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {\text {sin c} = \frac {1} {n}}
$$

- This equation shows that:
	- The **larger** the **refractive index**, the **smaller** the **critical angle**.
	- Light rays inside a material with a **high refractive index** are more likely to be **totally internally reflected**

## D. Optical fibres
- Total internal reflection is used to reflect light along **optical fibres**, meaning they can be used for:
	- Communication
	- Endoscope
	- Decorative lamps
- Light travelling down an optical fibre is **totally internally reflected** each time it hits the edge of the fibre.

- Optical fibres are used in medicine in order to see within the human body
