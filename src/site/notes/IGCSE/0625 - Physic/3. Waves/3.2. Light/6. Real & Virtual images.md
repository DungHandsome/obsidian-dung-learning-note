## A. Real & Virtual images
- An image produced by lenses can be either:
	- A **real** image
	- A **virtual** image

### I. Real images
- A real image is:

<center style="color:#c00000">An image that's formed when the light rays actually do come together</center>

- A real image is one produced by the **convergence** of light towards a focus
- Real images are always **inverted**.
- Real images can be projected onto pieces of paper or screens.
- Real images are where ***2 solid lines cross in ray diagrams***.

- Example:
	- Image formed in cinema's screen

### II. Virtual images
- A virtual image is:

<center style="color:#c00000">An image that's formed when the light rays don't come together where the image appears to be</center>

- A virtual image is formed by the **divergence** of light away from a point.
- Virtual images are always **upright**.
- Virtual images **cannot** be projected onto a piece of paper or a screen
	- An example of a virtual image is a person's reflection in a mirror

- Virtual images are where two **dashed lines,** or **one dashed and one solid line** crosses in ray diagrams

## B. Types of lenses and images generated
- The image produced by converging lenses can be either real or virtual
- The image produced by con

### I. Converging lenses
- Converging lenses will generate **real image** when the object is placed **further** than its **focal point** and generate **virtual image** when the object is placed **nearer** than its **focal point**.

#### Real image
- Real images will be formed if the objects are placed **further** than the **focal point**.

- There's 2 cases:
	- Case 1: Object is placed at a distance **between** one focal length (from centre to *f*) and two focal length (from centre to *2f*)
	- Case 2: Object is placed **further** than two focal length (from centre to *2f*)

- In case 1, the image will be:
	- **Real**
	- ***Enlarged***
	- **Inverted**

- In case 2, the image will be:
	- **Real**
	- ***Diminished (smaller)***
	- **Inverted**

#### Virtual image
- Virtual images will be formed if the objects are placed **nearer** to the centre than the **focal point**.

- In this case, the image is:
	- **Virtual**
	- **Diminished (smaller)**
	- **Upright**
