## Pitch and loudness
- The frequency of a sound wave is related to its **pitch**
    - Sounds with a **high** pitch have a **high** frequency (or short wavelength)
    - Sounds with a **low** pitch have a **low** frequency (or long wavelength)
- The amplitude of a sound wave is related to its **volume**
    - Sounds with a **large** amplitude have a **high** volume
    - Sounds with a **small** amplitude have a **low** volume

## Echoes
- Sound waves **reflect** off hard surfaces
    - The reflection of a sound wave is called an **echo**
- Echo sounding can be used to **measure depth** or to detect objects **underwater**.
    - A sound wave can be transmitted from the surface of the water
    - The sound wave is **reflected off** the bottom of the ocean
- The time it takes for the sound wave to return is used to calculate the **depth** of the water
- The distance the wave travels is **twice** the depth of the ocean
    - This is the distance to the ocean floor plus the distance for the wave to return
