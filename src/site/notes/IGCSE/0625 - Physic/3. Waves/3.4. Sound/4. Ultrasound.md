## A. Ultrasound
- Humans can hear sounds between **20 Hz** and **20000 Hz**.
- **Ultrasound** is the name given to sound waves with a frequency **greater** than **20000 Hz**.

> [!NOTE] Remember!
> Hertz (Hz) is the unit for **Frequency** - The number of wave pass through a point in 1 second.

## B. Uses of Ultrasound
- When ultrasound reaches a boundary between two media, some of the waves are partially reflected
- The remainder of the waves continue through the material and are transmitted
- Ultrasound transducers are able to:
    - **Emit** ultrasound
    - **Receive** ultrasound
- The time taken for the reflections to reach a detector can be used to determine how far away a boundary is
    - This is because ultrasound travels at different speeds through different media

- This allows ultrasound waves to be used for both **medical** and **industrial** imaging

### I. Ultrasound in Medicine
- In medicine, ultrasound can be used:
    - To construct images of a **foetus** in the womb
    - To generate 2D images of **organs** and other internal structures (as long as they are **not** surrounded by bone)
    - As a medical **treatment** such as removing kidney stones
- An ultrasound detector is made up of a **transducer** that produces and detects a beam of ultrasound waves into the body
- The ultrasound waves are reflected back to the transducer by **boundaries** between tissues in the path of the beam
    - For example, the boundary between fluid and soft tissue or tissue and bone
- When these echoes hit the transducer, they generate electrical signals that are sent to the ultrasound scanner
- Using the speed of sound and the time of each echo’s return, the detector calculates the distance from the transducer to the tissue boundary
- By taking a series of ultrasound measurements, sweeping across an area, the time measurements may be used to build up an **image**
- Unlike many other medical imaging techniques, ultrasound is **non-invasive** and is believed to be **harmless**

### II. Ultrasound in industry
- In industry, ultrasound can be used to:
    - Check for cracks inside metal objects
    - Generate images beneath surfaces
- A crack in a metal block will cause some waves to reflect earlier than the rest, so will show up as pulses on an oscilloscope trace
    - Each pulse represents each time the wave crosses a boundary
- The speed of the waves is constant, so measuring the time between emission and detection can allow the distance from the source to be calculated
