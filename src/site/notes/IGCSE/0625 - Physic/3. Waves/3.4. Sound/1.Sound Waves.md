## A. Describing sound
- **Sound waves** are produced by **vibrating** sources.
- When a sound wave comes into contact with a solid, those vibrations can be **transferred** to the solid
    - For example, sound waves can cause a drinking glass to vibrate
    - If the glass vibrates too much the movement causes the glass to shatter

- Sound waves are longitudinal, meaning the molecules vibrate in the same direction as the energy transfer.
- Sound waves require a medium to travel through.
	- This means sound can't travel through a vacuum.

## B. Compression and Rarefaction
- Longitudinal waves consist of **compression** and **rarefaction**.
	- A **Compression** is a region of **higher density** i.e. a place where the molecules are **bunched** together.
	- A **rarefaction** is a region of lower density i.e. a place where the molecules are spread out.

- These compressions and rarefactions cause changes in pressure, which vary in time with the wave.
    - Therefore, sound is a type of **pressure wave**.
- When the waves hit a solid, the variations in pressure cause the surface of the solid to **vibrate** in sync with the sound wave

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> When describing compressions and rarefactions, make sure to use the correct terms. It is best to refer to them as regions of high and low densities of particles instead of the particles are more 'bunched up' or 'far apart', as this is too vague and not very scientific!
