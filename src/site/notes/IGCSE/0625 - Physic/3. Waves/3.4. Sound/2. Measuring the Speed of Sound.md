## Speed of sound in air
- Sound waves travel at a speed of about 340 m/s in air at room temperature
- The higher the air temperature, the greater the speed of sound
- The speed of sound in air varies from **330 – 350 m/s**

## Speed of sound in materials
- Sound's speed changes in different medium:
	- **Fastest** in _Solids_
	- **Slowest** in _Gases_
- Some typical speeds of sound:
