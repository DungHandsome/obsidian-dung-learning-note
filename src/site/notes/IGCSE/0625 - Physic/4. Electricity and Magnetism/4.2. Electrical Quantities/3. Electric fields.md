## A. Electric fields
- A charged object creates an **electric field** around itself
    - This is similar to the way in which magnets create magnetic fields

- This can be shown by electric field lines
    - Fields lines always point **away** **from** **positive** charges and **towards negative** charges

- The **direction** of the **field lines** in an **electric field** is described as:

<center style="color: #c00000">The direction of the force on a positive charge at that point</center>

![3. Electric fields-20240727211607876.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/3.%20Electric%20fields-20240727211607876.webp)

- Although the definition of the force direction refers to a **positive charge**, in demonstrations it is always **electrons** (negative charges) which are **free to move** according to that force

- The strength of an electric field depends on the **distance** from the object creating the field:
    - The field is **strongest** **close** to the charged object - this is shown by the field lines being **closer together**
    - The field becomes **weaker further away** from the charged object - this is shown by the field lines becoming **further apart**

## B. Electric field patterns
- Objects in an electric field will experience an **electrostatic force**
    - Since force is a **vector** quantity, the direction of this force depends on whether the **charges** are the same or opposite

- The force is either **attractive** or **repulsive**
    - If the charges are the **same** (negative and negative or positive and positive), this force will be **repulsive** and the second charged object will **move away** from the charge creating the field
    - If the charges are the **opposite** (negative and positive), this force will be **attractive** and the second charged object will **move toward** the charge creating the field

![3. Electric fields-20240727212355301.webp|500](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/3.%20Electric%20fields-20240727212355301.webp)

- The size of the force depends on the strength of the field at that point
- This means that the force becomes:
    - **Stronger** as the distance between the two charged objects **decreases**
    - **Weaker** as the distance between the two charged objects **increases**

- The relationship between the strength of the force and the distance applies to both the **force of attraction** and **force of repulsion**
    - Two negative charges brought close together will have a **stronger** repulsive force than if they were far apart

### I. Field lines around a point charge
- The **electric field** is the region in which another charge will experience a force

- Fields lines always go **away from positive charges** and **towards negative charges** – they have the same direction as the direction of the force on a positively charged particle at a point in that field

### II. Field lines between two oppositely charged parallel conducting plates
- The electric field between two parallel plates is a **uniform electric field**
- The field lines are:
    - Directed from the **positive** to the **negative** plate
    - Parallel
    - Straight lines

### III. Field lines around a charged conducting sphere
The field lines around a charge conducting sphere are symmetrical, as with a point charge
- This is because the charges on the surface of the sphere will be evenly distributed
- The charges are the same, so they repel
- The surface is conducting, allowing them to move

- This field line pattern can be demonstrated using a Van der Graaff Generator
- One method using streamers is shown
- Other methods often demonstrated in schools include
    - Small pieces of paper
    - Polystyrene beads
    - Aluminium foil containers
