> [!kt] Key Terms
> - **Potential difference (or Voltage, V)** (*Volts*): The rate of doing work or the difference of electrical potential between two points.
> - **Current, I** (*Amps*): The amount of charge passing through a point in a circuit every second.
> - **Electrical energy, P** (*Watts*): The rate of doing work (Work done per amount of time)
> - **Work Done, W** (*Joule*): The amount of energy transferred

## Equation
**Ohm's law**:
$$
R = \frac {V} {I}
$$
Power finding:
$$
P = \frac {E} {t} = \frac {W} {t}
$$

$$
P = IV
$$

Using ohm's law:
$$
P = IV
\textcolor {#c00000}{=>} V = \frac {P} {I}
\textcolor {#c00000}{=>} R = \frac {V} {I} = I^2 R
$$

$$
P = IV
\textcolor {#c00000}{=>} I = \frac {P} {V}
\textcolor {#c00000}{=>} R = \frac {V^2} {I}
\textcolor {#c00000}{=>} I = \frac {V^2} {R}
$$

Finding Energy:
$$
E = P \times t = VIt
$$

- Where:
    - _E_ = energy transferred (J)
    - _V_ = potential difference (V)
    - _I =_ current (A)
    - _t_ = time (s)
