## A. Current
- Definition:
<center style="color: #c00000">The current is the amount of charge passing a point in a circuit every second</center>

- (It is helpful to think of current as the **charge per second**)

- Charge, current and time are related by the following equation:

![5. Current-20240728090538175.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/5.%20Current-20240728090538175.webp)

- Where the symbols:
    - **_Q_ stands for charge (measured in coulombs, C)**
    - **_I_ stands for current (measured in amps, A)**

## B. Direct and Alternating current
- When two oppositely charged conductors are connected together (by a length of wire), charge will flow between the two conductors

![5. Current-20240728091728330.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/5.%20Current-20240728091728330.webp)

- This flow of charge is called an **electric current**
	- The greater the flow of charge, the greater the electric current

- Current can be direct current (dc) or alternating current (ac)
	- In terms of calculations they can be treated in the same way

![5. Current-20240728093220124.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/5.%20Current-20240728093220124.webp)

### Direct current (DC)
- Direct current is produced when using dried cells and batteries (and sometimes generator, although they're usually AC)
	- The electrons flow in 1 direction only, from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.

### Alternating current (AC)
- Alternating current typically comes from mains electricity and generators
- It is needed for use in **transformers** in the **National Grid** (covered later in this topic)
	- The direction of electron flow changes direction regularly
	- A typical **frequency** for the reversal of ac current in mains electricity is **50 Hz**.

## C. Measuring current
- Current is measure using **ammeter**.
- Ammeters should always be connected in series with the part of the circuit you wish to measure the current through
    - Ammeters measure the amount of charge passing through them per unit time, so the ammeter has to be in series so that all the charge flows through it

![5. Current-20240728093350208.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/5.%20Current-20240728093350208.webp)

- Ammeters can be either
    - **Digital** (with an electronic read out)
    - **Analogue** (with a needle and scale)

### Analogue ammeters
- Typical ranges are 0.1-1.0 A and 1.0-5.0 A for analogue ammeters
    - Always double check exactly where the marker is before an experiment, if not at zero, you will need to subtract this from all your measurements. They should be checked for zero errors before using
- They are also subject to **parallax error**
    - Always read the meter from a position directly perpendicular to the scale

### Digital ammeters
- Digital ammeters can measure very small currents, in mA or µA
- Digital displays show the measured values as digits and are more accurate than analogue displays
- They’re easy to use because they give a specific value and are capable of displaying more precise values
    - However digital displays may 'flicker' back and forth between values and a judgement must be made as to which to write down
- Digital ammeters should be checked for **zero error**
    - Make sure the reading is zero before starting an experiment, or subtract the “zero” value from the end results

## D. Electrical conduction in Metals
- **In a metal, current is caused by a flow of free (delocalised) electrons.**

![5. Current-20240728142754476.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/5.%20Current-20240728142754476.webp)

## E. Conventional current
- **Electrons are negatively charged**
- This means that the **electrons flow from negative to positive**
- **Conventional current**, however, is still defined as going from **positive to negative**
