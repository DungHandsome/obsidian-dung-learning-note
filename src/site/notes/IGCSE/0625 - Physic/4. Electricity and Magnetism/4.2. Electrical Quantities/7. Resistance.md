## A. Ohm's law
- **Resistance is the opposition to current**
    - For a given potential difference, the **higher the resistance, the lower the current**
    - Therefore resistors are used in circuits to control the current 
    - The unit of resistance is the **ohm**, represented by the Greek symbol omega **Ω**

- The definition of resistance can be given using the equation:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {R = \frac {V}{I}}
$$

- Where:
	- R = Resistance (Ohms, Ω)
	- V = Potential difference (Volts, V)
	- I = Current (Amperes, A)

- Ohm's law can be stated in word: **Current is directly proportional to potential difference as long as the temperature remains constant**

***Consequences of Ohm's Law***
- **Resistors** are used in **circuits** to control either
    - The current in branches of the circuit (through certain components)
    - The **potential difference** across certain components
- This is due to the consequences of Ohm's Law
    - The current in an electrical conductor decreases as its resistance increases (for a constant p.d.)
    - The p.d. across an electrical conductor increases as its resistance increases (for a constant current)

## B. I-V Graphs for Ohmic Resistors, Filament Lamps & Diodes
- As the **potential difference** (voltage) across a component is **increased**, the **current** in the component also **increases**
- The precise relationship between voltage and current can be different for different types of components and is shown by an IV graph:

- The IV graph **for a resistor** is very simple:

<center style="color: #c00000">The current is proportional to the potential difference</center>

- This is because the resistor has a **constant** resistance

- **For a lamp** the relationship is more complicated:

<center style="color: #c00000">The current increases at a proportionally slower rate than the potential difference</center>

- This is because:
    - The current causes the filament in the lamp to **heat up**
    - As the filament gets hot, its **resistance increases**
    - This opposes the current, causing it to increase at a **slower rate**

- The _I–V_ graph for a diode has a unique shape
    - When the diode is in **forward bias,** the graph shows a sharp increase in voltage and current (on the right side of the graph)
    - When the diode is switched around, in **reverse bias**, the graph shows a flat line where current is zero at all voltages (on the left side of the graph)
