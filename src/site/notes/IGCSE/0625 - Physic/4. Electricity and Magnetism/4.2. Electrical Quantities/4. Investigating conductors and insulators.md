## A. Conductors, insulators and electrons
- The key differences between conductors and insulators are:
	- **Conductors** allow **charge carriers** to **move freely**.
	- **Insulator** do **not** allow **charge carriers** to **move**.
- The reasons for this are to do with their internal structure

### I. Conductor
- A **conductor** is a material that allows **charge** (usually electrons) to flow through it easily
- Examples of conductors are:
    - Silver
    - Copper
    - Aluminium
    - Steel
- Conductors tend to be metals

- On the atomic scale, conductors are made up of positively charged metal ions with their outermost electrons **delocalised**
    - This means the electrons are free to move

- Metals conduct electricity very well because:
    - Current is the rate of flow of charged particles
    - So, the more easily electrons are able to flow, the **better** the conductor

### II. Insulators
- An **insulator** is a material that has **no free charges,** hence does **not** allow the flow of charge through them very easily
- Examples of insulators are:
    - Rubber
    - Plastic
    - Glass
    - Wood

- Some non-metals, such as wood, allow some charge to pass through them
- Although they are not very good at conducting, they do conduct a little in the form of **static** electricity
    - For example, two insulators can build up charge on their surfaces. If those surfaces touch, this would allow that charge to be conducted away

## B. Investigation electrical conductors and insulators

### The Gold-leaf Electroscope (GLE)
- To distinguish between conductors and insulators a **Gold-leaf electroscope (GLE)** can be used

![4. Investigating conductors and insulators-20240728084927460.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/4.%20Investigating%20conductors%20and%20insulators-20240728084927460.webp)

- The GLE consists of
    - A **metal plate** attached to one end of a **metal rod**
    - At the other end of the **rod** a very **thin leaf of gold foil** is attached
    - The rod is held by an **insulating collar** inside a box with **glass sides**, allowing the gold leaf to both be seen and protected from draughts

- When the GLE is charged, the plate, rod and gold leaf have the same charge (either positive or negative)
    - Since the rod and leaf have the **same charge**, they **repel**, and the leaf sticks out to the side
    - When the rod and leaf are discharged (are **neutral**) the leaf **hangs down**

### To test electrical conductors and insulators
- Charge the plate of the GLE so that the gold leaf stands clear of the rod
- Carefully touch the plate of the GLE with the items being tested, for example:
    - Metals, such as: wire, paperclip, scissor blades
    - Non-metals, such as: paper, fingers, glass, graphite
    - Plastics, such as: plastic ruler, the handles of the scissors, finger in a plastic sandwich bag
    - Comparisons, such as: wet cloth, dry cloth; finger and finger in a plastic sandwich bag

- Record the observations each time
    - **Leaf falls**: material is a **good** conductor
    - Leaf **remains** in place: object is a **poor** conductor (good insulator)
    - Leaf **falls slowly**: material is a **poor** conductor

### Alternative method
- An **electronic charge detector** can be used in place of the Gold-leaf Electroscope

### Expected Results
- Overall, **metals** are very good **conductors** whilst **non-metals** tend to be good **insulators**
