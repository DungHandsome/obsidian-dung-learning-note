## A. Resistance of a wire
- As electrons pass through a wire, they collide with the metal ions in the wire

![8. Resistance of a wire-20240729083811819.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.2.%20Electrical%20Quantities/Resources/8.%20Resistance%20of%20a%20wire-20240729083811819.webp)

- The ions get in the way of electrons, resisting their flow
- If the wire is longer, each electron will collide with more ions and so there will be more resistance: **The longer a wire, the _greater_ its resistance**
- If the wire is thicker (greater diameter) there is more space for the electrons and so more electrons can flow: **The thicker a wire, the _smaller_ its resistance**

## B. Proportionality Relationships for Electrical Conductors
- The relationship between resistance, length and cross-sectional area can be represented mathematically
	- Resistance is **directly** proportional to **length**
	- Resistance is **inversely** proportional to **cross-sectional area** (width, or thickness)

$$
R \propto L
$$

$$
R \propto \frac {1} {A}
$$
