## Electrical power equation
- In mechanics, power *P* is defined as the rate of doing work.
	- The Potential difference is the **work done by unit charged**
	- Current is the **rate of flow of charge**

- Therefore, the electrical power is defined as the **rate of change of work done**:

- The work done is the **energy transferred** so the power is the **energy transferred per second** in an electrical component

- The power dissipated (produced) by an electrical device can also be written as:

- Using Ohm's Law **_V_ = _IR_** to rearrange for either _V_ or _I_ and substituting into the power equation, means power can be written in terms of resistance _R_

- This means for a given resistor if the current or voltage **doubles** the power will be **four** times as great.
    - Which equation to use will depend on whether the value of current or voltage has been given in the question

- Rearranging the energy and power equation, the energy can be written as:

$$
E + VIt
$$

- Where:
    - _E_ = energy transferred (J)
    - _V_ = potential difference (V)
    - _I =_ current (A)
    - _t_ = time (s)
