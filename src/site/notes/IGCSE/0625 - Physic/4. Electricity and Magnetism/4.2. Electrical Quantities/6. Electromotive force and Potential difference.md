## A. Electromotive force
- The electromotive Force (e.m.f.) is the name given to the potential difference of the power source in a circuit.
- It's defined as:

<center style="color: #c00000">The electrical work done by a source in moving a unit charge around a complete circuit</center>

- Electromotive force (e.m.f.) is measured in volts (V)

- The definition of e.m.f. can also be expressed using an equation:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {E= \frac{W}{Q}}
$$

- Where:
	- *E* = Electromotive force (e.m.f.) (V)
	- *W* = energy supplied **to the charges** from the power source (J)
	- *Q* = charge on each charge carrier (C)  
		**Note:** in circuits the charge carriers are electrons

- This equation should be compared to the definition of potential difference (below) as the two are closely related

## B. Potential difference
- As charge flows around a circuit energy is transferred from the power source to the charge carriers, and then to the components
    - This is what makes components such as bulbs light up
    - The potential difference between two points in a circuit is related to the amount of energy transferred between those points in the circuit

- Potential difference is:

<center style="color: #c00000">The work done by a unit charge passing through a component</center>

- Potential difference is measured in Volts (V)

**The potential difference is the difference in the electrical potential across each component: 5 volts for the bulb (on the left) and 7 volts for the resistor (on the right)**

- The definition of p.d. can also be expressed using an equation:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {V= \frac{W}{Q}}
$$

- Where
    - _V_ = potential difference (p.d.) (V)
    - _W_ = energy transferred to the components **from the charge carriers** (J)
    - _Q_ = charge on each charge carrier (C)
		**Note:** in circuits the charge carriers are electrons

- This equation should be compared to the definition of e.m.f. as the two are closely related due to conservation of energy

## C. Measuring potential difference
- Potential difference is measured using a **voltmeter**, which can be either
    - **Digital** (with an electronic read out)
    - **Analogue** (with a needle and scale)
- Voltmeters are connected in **parallel** with the component being tested
    - The potential difference is the **difference** in electrical potential between two points, therefore the voltmeter has to be connected to **two points** in the circuit

### Analogue voltmeters
- **Analogue voltmeters** are subject to parallax error
    - Always read the meter from a position directly perpendicular to the scale

- Typical ranges are 0.1-1.0 V and 0-5.0 V for analogue voltmeters although they can vary
    - Always double check exactly where the marker is before an experiment, if not at **zero**, you will need to subtract this from all your measurements
    - They should be checked for **zero errors** before using

### Digital voltmeters
- **Digital voltmeters** can measure very small potential differences, in mV or µV
- Digital displays show the measured values as digits and are more accurate than analogue displays
- They’re easy to use because they give a specific value and are capable of displaying more precise values
    - However digital displays may 'flicker' back and forth between values and a judgement must be made as to which to write down
- Digital voltmeters should be checked for zero error
    - Make sure the reading is zero before starting an experiment, or subtract the “zero” value from the end results

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> When you are actually building a circuit in class, always **save the voltmeter until last.**
>
> Make the whole circuit first and check it works.
>
> Only then pick up the voltmeter. Connect two leads to your voltmeter. Now connect the leads so that they are one on each side of the component you are measuring. This will save you a LOT of time waiting for your teacher to troubleshoot your circuit!
