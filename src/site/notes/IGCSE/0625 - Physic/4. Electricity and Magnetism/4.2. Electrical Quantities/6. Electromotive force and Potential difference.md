## Electromotive force
- The electromotive Force (e.m.f.) is the name given to the potential difference of the power source in a circuit.
- It's defined as:

<center style="color: #c00000">The electrical work done by a source in moving a unit charge around a complete circuit</center>

- Electromotive force (e.m.f.) is measured in volts (V)

- The definition of e.m.f. can also be expressed using an equation:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {E= \frac{W}{Q}}
$$

- Where:
	- *E* = Electromotive force (e.m.f.) (V)
	- *W* = energy supplied **to the charges** from the power source (J)
	- *Q* = charge on each charge carrier (C)  
		**Note:** in circuits the charge carriers are electrons
