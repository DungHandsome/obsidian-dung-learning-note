- Objects can be given one of two types of electric charge:
    - **Positive**
    - **Negative**

- When two charged objects are brought close together, there will be a force between those objects

- Remember:
    - **Opposite charges attract**
    - **Like charges repel**

- Electric charge is measured in units called **coulombs (C)**
