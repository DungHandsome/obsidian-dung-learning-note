## Electrical energy equation
- Everyday appliances transfer electrical energy from the mains to other forms of energy in the appliance
    - For example, in a heater, this will transfer **electrical energy** into a **thermal energy store**

- The amount of energy an appliance transfers depends on:
    - How **long** the appliance is switched on for
    - The **power** of the appliance

- A 1 kW iron uses the **same** amount of energy in 1 hour as a 2 kW iron would use in 30 minutes
- A 100 W heater uses the **same** amount of energy in 30 hours as a 3000 W heater does in 1 hour

- To calculate electrical energy use the equation:

$$
E = VIt
$$

- Where:
	- _E_ = energy (joules, J)
	- _V_ = voltage (volts, V)
	- _I_ = current (amps, A)
	- _t_ = time (seconds, s)

> Remember that Kilo (k) means 1000, so 1kW = 1000W

## Energy transfer in electrical circuits
- As electricity passes around a circuit, energy is transferred from the power source to the various components (which may then transfer energy to the surroundings)
    - As charge passes through the power supply it is given energy
    - As it passes through each component it loses some energy (transferring that energy to the component)

- Different domestic appliances transfer energy from batteries, such as a remote control
- Most household appliances transfer energy from the AC mains
- This can be to the **kinetic energy** of an **electric motor.** Motors are used in:
    - Vacuum cleaners - to create the suction to suck in dust and dirt off carpets
    - Washing machines - to rotate the drum to wash (or dry) clothes
    - Refrigerators - to compress the refrigerant chemical into a liquid to reduce the temperature

- Or, in **heating** devices. Heating is used in:
    - Toasters - to toast bread
    - Kettles - to boil hot water
    - Radiators - hot water is pumped from the boiler so the radiator can heat up a room
