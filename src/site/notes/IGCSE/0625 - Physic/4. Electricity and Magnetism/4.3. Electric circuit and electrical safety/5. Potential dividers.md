## Variable Potential Dividers
- When two resistors are connected in series, the potential difference across the power source is shared between them

![5. Potential dividers-20240730084353909.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.3.%20Electric%20circuit%20and%20electrical%20safety/Resources/5.%20Potential%20dividers-20240730084353909.webp)

- The potential difference across each resistor depends upon its resistance:
    - The resistor with the largest resistance will have a greater potential difference than the other one
    - If the resistance of one of the resistors is increased, it will get a greater share of the potential difference, whilst the other resistor will get a smaller share

- A **potentiometer** is a single component that (in its simplest form) consists of a coil of wire with a sliding contact, midway along it

<center>A potentiometer is a kind of variable resistor</center>

- The sliding contact has the effect of separating the potentiometer into two parts – an upper part and a lower part – both of which have different resistances

- If the slider in the above diagram is moved upwards, the resistance of the lower part will increase and so the potential difference across it will also increase

## Resistors as Potential Dividers
- When two resistors are connected in series, through Kirchhoff’s Second Law, the potential difference across the power source is divided between them
- Potential dividers are circuits which produce an output voltage as a **fraction** of its input voltage
- Potential dividers have two main purposes:
    - To provide a variable potential difference
    - To enable a specific potential difference to be chosen
    - To split the potential difference of a power source between two or more components

- Potential dividers are used widely in volume controls and sensory circuits using LDRs and thermistors
- Potential divider circuits are based on the ratio of voltage between components. This is equal to the ratio of the resistances of the resistors in the diagram below, giving the following equation:

- Where:
    - _R<sub>2</sub>_ is the numerator and the resistance of the resistor over _Vout_ 
    - _R<sub>1</sub>_ is the other resistance in series
    - _V<sub>out</sub>_ is the output potential difference
    - _V<sub>in</sub>_ is the input potential difference

- The potential divider equation can also be written:

$$
\textcolor {#c00000} {V_{out} = \frac {R_1} {R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}}
$$

- Where this time:
    - _R<sub>1</sub>_ is the numerator and the resistance of the resistor over _V<sub>out</sub>_ 
    - _R<sub>2</sub>_ is the other resistance in series
- Whichever notation you use you will obtain the same answer
    - The **numerator** has to be the resistance of the **resistor over _V<sub>out</sub>_**
