## A. Electrical Hazards
- Mains electricity is potentially lethal – potential differences as small as **50 volts** can pose a serious hazard to individuals

- Common hazards include:
    - **Damaged Insulation** – If someone touches an exposed piece of wire, they could be subjected to a lethal shock
    - **Overheating of cables** – Passing too much current through too small a wire (or leaving a long length of wire tightly coiled) can lead to the wire overheating. This could cause a fire or melt the insulations, exposing live wires
    - **Damp conditions** – If moisture comes into contact with live wires, the moisture could conduct electricity either causing a short circuit within a device (which could cause a fire) or posing an electrocution risk
    - **Excess current from overloading of plugs, extension leads, single and multiple sockets when using a mains supply** - If plugs or sockets become overloaded due to plugging in too many components the heat created can cause fires

## B. Mains circuits
### Mains electricity
- Mains electricity is the electricity generated by power stations and transported around the country through the National Grid
    - Everyone connects to the mains when plugging in an appliance such as a phone charger or kettle

- Mains electricity is an **alternating current** (a.c.) supply
- In the UK, the domestic electricity supply has a **frequency** of **50 Hz** and a **potential difference** of about **230 V**
    - A frequency of 50 Hz means the direction of the current changes back and forth 50 times every second

- Mains electricity, being an alternating current, does not have positive and negative sides to the power source
    - The equivalent to positive and negative are called **live** and **neutral** and these form either end of the electrical circuit

In order to protect the user or the device, there are several safety features built into domestic appliances, including:
- Double insulation
- Earthing
- Fuses
- Circuit breakers

### Insulation & Double Insulation
- The conducting part of a wire is usually made of copper or some other metal
    - If this comes into contact with a person, this poses a risk of electrocution

- For this reason, wires are covered with an insulating material, such as rubber
