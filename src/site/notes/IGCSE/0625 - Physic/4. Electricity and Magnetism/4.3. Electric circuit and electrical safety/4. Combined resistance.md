## A. Resistors in Series & Parallel
### I. Resistors in Series
- When two or more components are connected in series:
    - **The combined resistance of the components is equal to the sum of individual resistances**

### II. Resistors in parallel
- When resistors are connected in parallel, the combined resistance decreases and is less than the resistance of any of the individual components
- If two resistors of equal resistance are connected in parallel, then the combined resistance will halve

## B. Determining Resistance in Parallel
- More generally, to determine the combined resistance of any combination of two resistors, you must use the equation:

$$

$$

- To calculate the resistance:
    - First find the value of _1/R_ (by adding _1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub>_)
    - Next find the value of _R_ by using the reciprocal button on your calculator (labelled either _x-1_ or _1/x_, depending on your calculator)
