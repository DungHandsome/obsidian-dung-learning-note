## Potential Difference in Series Circuits
- When several cells are connected together in series, their combined EMF is equal to the sum of their individual EMFs

<center>The total EMF of these cells is equal to the sum of their individual EMFs</center>

- In a series circuit, the sum of potential differences across the components is equal to the total EMF of the power supply

<center>In a series circuit the components share the EMF of the power supply</center>

## Potential Difference in Parallel Circuits
- A parallel circuit consists of two or more components attached along separate branches of the circuit
- The **advantages** of this kind of circuit are:
    - **The components can be individually controlled, using their own switches**
    - **If one component stops working the others will continue to function**

- The **potential difference** across each component **connected in parallel** is the **same**
    - This is the **opposite** of the current, which is different in each branch
