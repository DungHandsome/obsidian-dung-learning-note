## A. Current in Series Circuits
- In a circuit that is a closed-loop, such as a series circuit, the current is the **same value at any point**
	- This is because the number of electrons per second that passes through one part of the circuit is the same number that passes through any other part

- This means that **all** components in a closed-loop have the same current

- The amount of current flowing around a series circuit depends on two things:
    - The **voltage** of the power source
    - The **resistance** of the components in the circuit

- **Increasing** the **voltage** of the power source drives **more** **current** around the circuit
    - So, decreasing the voltage of the power source reduces the current
- **Increasing** the **number** of components in the circuit **increases** the **total** **resistance**
    - Hence **less** **current** flows through the circuit

## B. Current in Parallel Circuits
- A parallel circuit consists of two or more components attached along separate branches of the circuit

![2. Current in circuit-20240729155852353.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.3.%20Electric%20circuit%20and%20electrical%20safety/Resources/2.%20Current%20in%20circuit-20240729155852353.webp)

- The **advantages** of this kind of circuit are:
    - **The components can be individually controlled, using their own switches**
    - **If one component stops working the others will continue to function**

- **In a parallel circuit, the current splits up** - some of it going one way and the rest going the other
- This means that the current in each branch will be smaller than the current from the power supply

- At a **junction** in a **parallel** **circuit** (where two or more wires meet) the current is **conserved**
    - This means the amount of current flowing into the junction is equal to the amount of current flowing out of it

- This is because **charge** is conserved

- Note that the current does not always split equally – often there will be more current in some branches than in others
    - The current in each branch will only be identical if the **resistance** of the components along each branch are **identical**

- Current behaves in this way because it is the **flow of electrons**:
    - Electrons are physical matter – they cannot be created or destroyed
    - This means the total number of electrons (and hence current) going around a circuit must remain the same
    - When the electrons reach a junction, however, some of them will go one way and the rest will go the other

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> The direction of current flow is super important when considering junctions in a circuit.You should remember that current flows from the **positive** terminal to the **negative** terminal of a cell / battery. This will help determine the direction current is flowing 'in' to a junction and which way the current then flows 'out'.
