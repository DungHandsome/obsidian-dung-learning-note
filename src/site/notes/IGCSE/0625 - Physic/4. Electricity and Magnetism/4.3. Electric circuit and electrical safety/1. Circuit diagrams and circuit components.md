## Circuit component
- The diagram below shows the circuit symbols that could be used in circuit diagrams
    - You will be expected to know **what each component is** and **how it behaves** in a circuit

![1. Circuit diagrams and circuit components-20240729154102181.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.3.%20Electric%20circuit%20and%20electrical%20safety/Resources/1.%20Circuit%20diagrams%20and%20circuit%20components-20240729154102181.webp)

**Power supplies**
- Cells, batteries, power supplies and generators all **supply current** to the circuit

**Resistors**
- Potential dividers, fixed and variable resistors, thermistors and light-dependent resistors (LDRs) are all used to **control current**

**Meters**
- Ammeters and voltmeters are used to measure the current and potential difference
    - Ammeters are always connected in series whilst voltmeters are always connected in parallel

**Electromagnetic Components**
- Magnetising coils, relays and transformers use electromagnetic effects
    - Relays use a small current in one circuit to switch on a much larger current in another
    - Transformers 'step up' and 'step down' current and potential difference

**Fuses**
- Protect expensive components from current surges and act as a safety measure against fire

**Thermistors**
- A thermistor is a **non-ohmic** conductor and a temperature-dependent resistor
- The resistance of a thermistor changes depending on its **temperature**
    - As the temperature **increases** the resistance of a thermistor **decreases** and vice versa

**Light-dependent Resistors**
- A light-dependent resistor (LDR) is a non-ohmic conductor and sensory resistor
- Its resistance automatically changes depending on the light energy falling onto it (illumination)
- As the **light intensity increases**, the **resistance** of an LDR **decreases**

## B. Diodes
- In addition to the above, you should be able to recognise and draw the circuit symbol for a diode:

<center style='color: #c00000;'>A diode is a component that only allows a current in one direction</center>

(Note: diodes are occasionally drawn with a horizontal line running through the middle of them)
