- In your IGCSE examination you might be asked to describe a method of plotting the magnetic field around a bar magnet
- There are two principle ways of doing this:

#### Using iron fillings
- Place a piece of paper on top of the magnet
- Gently sprinkle iron filings on top of the paper
- Now carefully tap the paper to allow the iron filings to settle on the field lines
