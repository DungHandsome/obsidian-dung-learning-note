## A. Properties of Magnets
- The ends of magnet are called **poles**.
- Magnets have 2 poles: **North** and **South**.

- Magnets are objects which experience **attraction** and **repulsion**
    - **Like poles repel** (push each other apart)
        - For example, a north pole will **repel** a north pole and a south pole will **repel** a south pole
    - **Unlike poles attract** (move towards each other)
        - For example, a north pole will be **attracted** to a south pole

- When two magnets are held close together, there will be a force between the magnets

- **Magnetic** materials:
    - Experience a **force** when placed in a magnetic field
    - Are attracted to a magnet when **unmagnetised**
    - Can be **magnetised** to form a magnet
- Only a **magnet** can **repel** another magnet (This can be a useful test for a magnet)

- **Non-magnetic materials** do **not** experience a force when placed in a magnetic field

## B. Uses of Magnets
### I. Uses of Permanent magnets
- Permanent magnets are **usually** (but not always) made from **steel**
- They tend to stay **magnetised**

- Permanent magnets have many uses including
    - **Compasses:** for thousands of years humans have used compasses for navigation, since the needle always points north
    - **School lab experiments:** the magnets used in school science demonstrations are permanent magnets
    - **Toys:** toy trains and trucks often have magnets which attach the carriages or trailers to the engine or cab
    - **Fridge magnets:** these are made either of flexible magnetic material or by sticking a magnet to the back of something

### II. Uses of electromagnets
- **Electromagnets** use **electricity** to create a magnet from a **current-carrying** wire
    - They have the advantage that they can be **magnetised** and **demagnetised**, literally at the flick of a switch
    - They can be switched on and off
- **Soft iron** is the metal normally used for this
    - It can easily become a temporary magnet

- Electromagnets have many uses including
    - **MRI scanners:** in hospitals, an MRI scanner is a large, cylindrical machine using powerful electromagnets to produce diagnostic images of the organs of the body
    - **Speakers and earphones:** the loudspeakers, microphones and earphones used in phones and laptops use electromagnets to sense or send soundwaves
    - **Recycling:** because steel is a magnetic material it can be easily separated from other metals and materials using electromagnets. Once recovered the steel is re-used and recycled, reducing mining for iron ore and processing ore into steel
    - **Mag-Lev Trains:** the ability of Mag-Lev trains to hover above the rails is due to them being repelled by large electromagnets on the train and track. This reduces friction and allows speeds of nearly 400 miles per hour
