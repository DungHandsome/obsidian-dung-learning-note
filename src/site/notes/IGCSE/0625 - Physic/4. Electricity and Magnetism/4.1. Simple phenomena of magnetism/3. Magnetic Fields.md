## A. Magnetic field

- All magnets are surrounded by a **magnetic field**.
- A magnetic field is:

<center style="color: #c00000">The region around magnet where a force acts on another magnet or on a magnetic material</center>

- Two bar magnets can be used to produce a **uniform** magnetic field.
- Point opposite poles (north and south) of the two magnets a few centimetres apart
- A **uniform** magnetic field will be produced in the **gaps** between **opposite poles**
    - Note: Outside that gap, the field will **not** be uniform

> [!NOTE] Note
> A **uniform field** is created when two opposite poles are held close together. Magnetic fields are always directed from North to South

- A uniform magnetic field is one that has the **same strength and direction at all points**
    - To show that the magnetic field has the same strength at all points there must be **equal spacing** between all magnetic field lines
    - To show that the magnetic field is acting in the same direction at all points there must be an arrow on each magnetic field line going from the **north** pole to the **south** pole

- The magnetic field lines are the **same distance apart** between the gaps of the poles to indicate that the field strength is the same at every point between the poles
- This field can be determined by using plotting compasses that will point from **north** to **south** or by using iron filings

### I. Magnetic field lines
- Magnetic field lines are used to represent the **strength** and **direction** of a magnetic field
- The direction of the magnetic field is shown using **arrows**

- There are some rules which must be followed when drawing magnetic field lines. Magnetic field lines:
    - Always go **from north to south** (indicated by an arrow midway along the line)
    - Must **never touch or cross** other field lines

### II. Magnetic field around a bar magnet
- The magnetic field is **strongest at the poles**
    - This is where the magnetic field lines are **closest** together

- The magnetic field becomes **weaker as the distance from the magnet increases**
- This is because the magnetic field lines are getting **further apart**

## B. Magnetic field strength
- The **strength** of the magnetic field is shown by the **spacing** of the magnetic field lines
    - If the magnetic field lines are **close together** then the magnetic field will be **strong**
    - If the magnetic field lines are **far apart** then the magnetic field will be **weak**

- Magnetic forces are due to interactions between magnetic fields
    - Two bar magnets can repel or attract

- The field lines will look slightly different for each:

- Therefore, the magnetic field lines around different configurations of two bar magnets would look like:

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> If you are asked to draw the magnetic field around a bar magnet remember to indicate both the **direction** of the magnetic field and the **strength** of the magnetic field.You can do this by:
> - Adding arrows pointing away from the north pole and towards the south pole
> - Making sure the magnetic field lines are further apart as the distance from the magnet increases
