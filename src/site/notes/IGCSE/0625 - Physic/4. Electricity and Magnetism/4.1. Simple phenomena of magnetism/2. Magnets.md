## A. Magnetic and Non-magnetic materials

- There's only some metals in the periodic table magnetic:
	- Iron
	- Cobalt
	- Nickel

- Steel is an alloy which contains iron, so it's also magnetic.
- Magnetic materials (which are not magnets) will always be **attracted** to the magnet, regardless of which pole is held close to it.

- To test whether a material is a magnet it should be brought close to a known magnet
    - If it can be **repelled** by the known magnet then the material itself is a magnet
    - If it can only be **attracted** and **not repelled** then it is a magnetic material

## B. Types of Magnets
- There're 2 types of magnets:
	- Permanent magnets
	- Induced magnets

### I. Permanent magnets
- Permanent magnets are made out of permanent magnetic materials, for example **steel**
- A permanent magnet will **produce its own magnetic field**
    - It will not lose its magnetism

### II. Temporary (induced) magnets
- When a magnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, the material can **temporarily** be turned into a magnet
    - This is called **induced magnetism**

- Some objects such as paperclips or needles (which are made from steel) can be magnetised and will remain magnetic for a while
    - Other objects, such as electromagnets or transformers (which are made from **soft iron**) will be demagnetised as soon as the cause of the induced magnetism is removed

- When magnetism is induced on a material:
    - One end of the material will become a north pole
    - The other end will become a south pole

- Magnetic materials will always be **attracted** to a permanent magnet
    - This means that the end of the material closest to the magnet will have the **opposite** pole to magnets pole closest to the material

- When the magnetic material is removed from the magnetic field it will lose most/all of its magnetism quickly
