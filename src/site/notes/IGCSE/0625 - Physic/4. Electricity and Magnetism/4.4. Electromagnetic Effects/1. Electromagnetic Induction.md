## A. Induced emf
- An electromotive force (emf) is induced in a conductor whenever there is **relative movement** between the conductor and a magnetic field
- This could be when
    - the conductor moves in a stationary magnetic field
    - the conductor is stationary in a changing magnetic field

### Induced emf due to a moving conductor
- For an electrical conductor moving in a fixed magnetic field:
    - the conductor (e.g a wire) **cuts** the field lines
    - an emf is **induced** in the wire

### Induced emf due to a moving field
- For a fixed conductor in a changing magnetic field:  
    - as the magnet moved through the conductor (e.g. a coil), the field lines **cut** through the turns on the conductor (each individual wire)
    - an emf is **induced** in the coil

- A **sensitive voltmeter** can be used to measure the size of the induced emf
- If the conductor is part of a **complete circuit** then a **current** is induced in the conductor
    - This can be detected by an ammeter

> [!NOTE] Worked Example
> A coil of wire is connected to a sensitive voltmeter.
>
> When a magnet is pushed into the coil the needle on the voltmeter will deflect to the right as shown in the diagram below.

> What will happen to the pointer on the voltmeter when the magnet is stationary in the centre of the coil?
>
>**A**      The needle will deflect to the left
>
>**B**      The needle will deflect to the right
>
>**C**      There will be no deflection of the needle
>
>**D**      The needle will deflect to the left and then to the right


> [!NOTE] Answers: **C**
> - There is no relative movement between the coil and the magnetic field when both the magnet and coil are stationary
> - Since no magnetic field lines are being cut, no emf will be induced
> - Therefore, the needle will not deflect
>
> - **A**, **B** & **D** are incorrect because a deflection on the voltmeter would indicate that an emf has been induced
> - This would only happen if there was relative movement between the coil and the magnetic field

## B. Lenz's law
- Lenz law states:

<center style="color: #c00000">The direction of an induced emf always opposes the change causing it</center>

- This means that any magnetic field created by an induced emf will act so that it tries to stop the wire or magnet from moving
