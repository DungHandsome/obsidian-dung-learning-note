## A. Induced emf
- An electromotive force (emf) is induced in a conductor whenever there is **relative movement** between the conductor and a magnetic field
- This could be when
    - the conductor moves in a stationary magnetic field
    - the conductor is stationary in a changing magnetic field

### Induced emf due to a moving conductor
- For an electrical conductor moving in a fixed magnetic field:
    - the conductor (e.g a wire) **cuts** the field lines
    - an emf is **induced** in the wire

### Induced emf due to a moving field
- For a fixed conductor in a changing magnetic field:  
    - as the magnet moved through the conductor (e.g. a coil), the field lines **cut** through the turns on the conductor (each individual wire)
    - an emf is **induced** in the coil

![1. Electromagnetic Induction-20240730150409448.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.4.%20Electromagnetic%20Effects/Resources/1.%20Electromagnetic%20Induction-20240730150409448.webp)

- A **sensitive voltmeter** can be used to measure the size of the induced emf
- If the conductor is part of a **complete circuit** then a **current** is induced in the conductor
    - This can be detected by an ammeter

> [!NOTE] Worked Example
> A coil of wire is connected to a sensitive voltmeter.
>
> When a magnet is pushed into the coil the needle on the voltmeter will deflect to the right as shown in the diagram below.

> What will happen to the pointer on the voltmeter when the magnet is stationary in the centre of the coil?
>
>**A**      The needle will deflect to the left
>
>**B**      The needle will deflect to the right
>
>**C**      There will be no deflection of the needle
>
>**D**      The needle will deflect to the left and then to the right


> [!NOTE] Answers: **C**
> - There is no relative movement between the coil and the magnetic field when both the magnet and coil are stationary
> - Since no magnetic field lines are being cut, no emf will be induced
> - Therefore, the needle will not deflect
>
> - **A**, **B** & **D** are incorrect because a deflection on the voltmeter would indicate that an emf has been induced
> - This would only happen if there was relative movement between the coil and the magnetic field

## B. Lenz's law
- Lenz law states:

<center style="color: #c00000">The direction of an induced emf always opposes the change causing it</center>

- This means that any magnetic field created by an induced emf will act so that it tries to stop the wire or magnet from moving

_**Demonstrating Lenz law**_
- Lenz's law can be demonstrated when a magnet is pushed into, or out of, a coil of wire
- If the magnet is pushed north end first into the coil, the end of the coil closest to the magnet will become a **north pole**
- This happens because:  
    - the changing magnetic field induces an **emf** in the coil
    - the induced emf causes a current to flow and generates a magnetic field in the coil
    - the magnetic field due to the current **opposes** the magnet being pushed into the coil
    - therefore, the end of the coil closest to the magnet acts as a **north pole**
    - this means it **repels** the north pole of the magnet

![1. Electromagnetic Induction-20240730205726492.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.4.%20Electromagnetic%20Effects/Resources/1.%20Electromagnetic%20Induction-20240730205726492.webp)
<center><b>When a magnet is pushed into a coil of wire, the end of the coil closest to the magnet will become a north pole and oppose its motion</b></center>

- If a magnet is now pulled away from the coil of wire, the end of the coil closest to the magnet will become a **south pole**
- This happens because:  
    - the changing magnetic field induces an **emf** in the coil
    - the induced emf causes a current to flow and generates a magnetic field in the coil
    - the magnetic field due to the current **opposes** the magnet being pulled away from the coil
    - therefore, the end of the coil closest to the magnet becomes a **south pole**
    - this means it **attracts** the north pole of the magnet

![1. Electromagnetic Induction-20240730205855532.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.4.%20Electromagnetic%20Effects/Resources/1.%20Electromagnetic%20Induction-20240730205855532.webp)

<center><b>When a magnet is pulled away from a coil of wire, the end of the coil closest to the magnet will become a south pole and oppose its motion</b></center>

## C. Right-hand dynamo rule
- When moving a wire through a magnetic field, the direction of the induced emf can be determined using the **right-hand dynamo** rule

- **F**irst **F**inger = **F**ield:
    - Start by pointing the **f**irst **f**inger (on the right hand) in the direction of the **f**ield
- Thu**M**b = **M**otion:
    - Next, point the thu**m**b in the direction that the wire is **m**oving in
- Se**C**ond = **C**urrent:
    - The Se**c**ond finger will now be pointing in the direction of the **c**urrent (or, strictly speaking, the emf)

> Remember that current is always in the direction of positive charge carriers. Therefore, current flows from the positive to the negative terminal of the battery.
