## Simple A.C Generators
- The **generator effect** can be used to generate **a.c** in an **alternator**
- A simple alternator is a type of generator that produces an alternating current

![3. The A.C. Generator-20240731083441588.webp](/img/user/IGCSE/0625%20-%20Physic/4.%20Electricity%20and%20Magnetism/4.4.%20Electromagnetic%20Effects/Resources/3.%20The%20A.C.%20Generator-20240731083441588.webp)

- A rectangular coil is forced to spin in a **uniform magnetic field**
- The coil is connected to a centre-reading meter by **metal brushes** that press on two metal **slip rings**
    - The slip rings and brushes provide a **continuous** connection between the coil and the meter

- The coil turns in one direction:
    - The pointer defects first one way, then the opposite way, and then back again
    - This is because the coil **cuts through** the magnetic field lines and an **emf,** and therefore current, is **induced** in the coil

- The pointer deflects in both directions because the **current** in the circuit repeatedly **changes direction** as the coil spins
    - This is because the induced emf in the coil repeatedly changes its direction
    - This continues as long as the coil keeps turning in the **same** direction

- The induced emf and the current **alternate** because they repeatedly **change direction**

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> Motors and generators look very similar, but they do very different things.
> 
> When tackling a question on either of them, make sure you are writing about the right one! A **mo**tor takes in electricity and turns it into **motion**. A **generator** takes in motion and **generates** electricity.
> 
> You might be expected to give explanations of how these two things happen - make sure that you understand their subtle differences!

## Graphs for A.C. Generators
- The A.C. generator creates an **alternating current**, varying in size and direction as the coil rotates
- Potential difference (also called e.m.f.) is **induced** when coil rotates in the external magnetic field

![3. The A.C. Generator-20240731095636346.webp](/img/user/3.%20The%20A.C.%20Generator-20240731095636346.webp)

- When the number of field lines through the coil is at a **maximum**, induced e.m.f. is at a **minimum**
    - In positions 1 and 3 in the diagram below, the number of field lines through the coil is at a maximum and induced e.m.f. is zero in this position
- When the number of field lines through the coil is at a **minimum**, induced e.m.f. is at a **maximum**
    - In positions 2 and 4, no field lines pass through the centre of the coil


> [!tip] Exam Tips
> For your exam, you need to be aware that an alternating current can be produced by:
>
> - A **coil rotating** in a magnetic field
> - A **magnet rotating** within a coil
>
> Both will induce an e.m.f. in the coil as they both ensure the coil will experience a **changing** magnetic field.
