## Demonstrate induction
- Electromagnetic induction is used in:
    - electrical generators which convert mechanical energy to electrical energy
    - transformers which are used in electrical power transmission

- The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction can be demonstrated using
    - a magnet and a coil
    - a wire and a U-shaped magnet

### Experiment 1: moving a magnet through a coil
- When a coil is connected to a sensitive voltmeter, a bar magnet can be moved in and out of the coil to induce an emf

The expected results are...

**1. When the bar magnet is stationary, the voltmeter shows a zero reading**
- When the bar magnet is held still inside, or outside, the coil, there is no cutting of magnetic field lines
- As a result, **no emf is induced** in the coil

**2. When the bar magnet is moved inside the coil, there is a reading on the voltmeter**
- As the bar magnet moves, its magnetic field lines are cut by the coil
- This induces an **emf** within the coil, shown momentarily by the reading on the voltmeter

**3. When the bar magnet is moved back out of the coil, there is a reading on the voltmeter with the opposite sign** 
- As the magnet changes direction, the direction of the current changes
- An emf is induced in the **opposite direction**, shown momentarily by the reading on the voltmeter with the opposite sign

- Factors that will increase the induced emf are:
    - moving the magnet **faster** through the coil
    - adding **more turns** to the coil
    - increasing the **strength** of the bar magnet

### Experiment 2: moving a wire through a magnet
- When a long wire is connected to a voltmeter and moved between two magnets, an emf is induced
- The pattern of a magnetic field in a wire can be investigated using this setup
    - **Note:** there is no current flowing through the wire to start with

The expected results are...

**1. When the wire is stationary, the voltmeter shows a zero reading**
- When there is no relative motion between the wire and the magnetic field, no field lines are cut
    - As a result, **no emf is induced** in the wire

**2. As the wire is moved between the magnetic poles, there is a reading on the voltmeter**
- As the wire moves, it cuts the magnetic field lines of the magnet
- This induces an **emf** in the wire, shown momentarily by the reading on the voltmeter

**3. When the wire is moved back out of the magnet, there is a reading on the voltmeter with the opposite sign**
- As the wire changes direction, the direction of the current changes
- An emf is induced in the **opposite direction**, shown momentarily by the reading on the voltmeter with the opposite sign

- Factors that will increase the induced e.m.f are:
    - increasing the **length** of the wire
    - moving the wire between the magnets **faster**
    - increasing the **strength** of the magnets

## Factors affecting electromagnetic induction
The **magnitude** (size) of the induced emf is determined by...

**1. The speed at which the wire, coil or magnet is moved:**
- Increasing the speed will increase the rate at which the magnetic field lines are cut
- This will increase the size of the induced emf

**2. The number of turns on the coils in the wire:**
- Increasing the number of turns on the coils in the wire will increase the size of the induced emf
- This is because each turn (loop) of wire in the coil cuts the magnetic field lines 
- Therefore, the total induced emf increases with each additional turn (loop)

**3. The size of the coils:**
- Increasing the area of the coils will increase the size of the induced emf
- This is because there will be more wire to cut through the magnetic field lines

**4. The strength of the magnetic field:**
- Increasing the strength of the magnetic field will increase the size of the induced emf
- This is because there will be more magnetic field lines in a given area

The **direction** of the induced emf is determined by...

**1. The orientation of the poles of the magnet:**
- Switching the poles of the magnet induces an emf in the opposite direction

**2. The direction in which the wire, coil or magnet is moved:**
- Reversing the direction in which the wire, coil or magnet is moved induces an emf in the opposite direction


> [!tip] Exam Tips
> When discussing factors affecting the size of an induced emf, make sure to use the correct terminology:
>
> - say "add more **turns** to the coil" instead of “add more coils”. This is because these statements do not mean the same thing
> - say "a **stronger** magnet" instead of "a bigger magnet". This is because larger magnets are not necessarily stronger
